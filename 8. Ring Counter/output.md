# Ring Counter:-

A Ring Counter is a type of Digital Counter that consists of a series of flip-flops connected in a circular fashion. A ring counter using 4 D Flip-Flops  can be constructed by connecting the Q output of each DFF to the D input of the next DFF in a circular fashion, and connecting the output of the last DFF back to the input of the first DFF.

Here are the steps to design a ring counter using D flip-flops:

1. Determine the number of flip-flops needed for the desired sequence length. For example, a 4-bit ring counter requires four DFFs.

2. Connect the Q output of the first D Flip-Flops to the D input of the second D Flip-Flops , the Q output of the second D Flip-Flops to the D input of the third D Flip-Flops , and so on until the Q output of the last D Flip-Flops is connected to the D input of the first D Flip-Flops. This creates a circular connection between the D Flip-Flops.

3. Connect the clock input of all DFFs to a common CLOCK signal.

4. Set the D input of all DFFs to logic "0" or "1", depending on the desired starting state of the counter.

5. Power up the circuit and apply clock pulses. The counter will start counting from the initial state and cycle through the sequence of states in a circular fashion.

6. Number of Maximum Count=No. of Flip Flop Use
