# 8to3 Encoder:-

An 8 to 3 encoder is a digital circuit that has eight input lines and three output lines. The circuit converts an 8-bit input signal into a 3-bit output signal, where the output lines indicate which of the eight input lines is active.

The input lines are typically labeled I0 to I7, and the output lines are labeled Y0 to Y2. The output lines are usually binary-encoded, which means that only one of the output lines will be high at any given time, and the combination of high and low output lines represents the active input line.

8 to 3 encoders are commonly used in digital circuits for addressing, decoding, and multiplexing applications. They can be implemented using various logic gates such as AND gates, OR gates, and NOT gates.
