# Shifter:-

A shifter, also known as a shift register, is a digital circuit or operation that performs shifting of binary data or bits within a register. It allows the movement of bits in a specific direction (left or right) by a certain number of positions.

In digital systems, shifters are commonly used for various purposes, including data manipulation, arithmetic operations, and implementation of certain algorithms. They are often implemented using flip-flops or other storage elements.

There are two types of shifters based on the direction of shifting:

1. Left Shifter: A left shifter moves the bits towards the left side of the register, pushing the leftmost bit out and inserting zeros at the rightmost side. Each bit is shifted to the adjacent higher position. It effectively multiplies the binary value by powers of 2.

2. Right Shifter: A right shifter moves the bits towards the right side of the register, pushing the rightmost bit out and inserting zeros at the leftmost side. Each bit is shifted to the adjacent lower position. It effectively divides the binary value by powers of 2.
