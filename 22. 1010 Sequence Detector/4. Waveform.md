# 1010 Sequence Detector:
​
​
A 1010 sequence detector is a digital circuit or state machine designed to detect the presence of the sequence "1010" in a stream of binary data. It looks for consecutive occurrences of the bits 1, 0, 1, and 0 in that order.
​
The 1010 sequence detector can be implemented using various methods, such as using a state machine or using combinational logic. Let's focus on the state machine approach.
​
In a state machine implementation, the detector has multiple states that represent different parts of the sequence. The state machine transitions from one state to another based on the input data.
​
Here's a simple example of a 1010 sequence detector using a state machine approach:
​
1. Define the states:
​
  * State 0: Initial state
  * State 1: Found '1'
  * State 2: Found '10'
  * State 3: Found '101'
  * State 4: Sequence detected ('1010')
​
2. Initialize the state machine to State 0.
​
3. On each clock cycle, check the input data:
​
  * If the input data is '1' and the current state is State 0, transition to State 1.
  * If the input data is '0' and the current state is State 1, transition to State 2.
  * If the input data is '1' and the current state is State 2, transition to State 3.
  * If the input data is '0' and the current state is State 3, transition to State 4.
​
4. If the state machine reaches State 4, it means the 1010 sequence has been detected.
​
5. If the input data doesn't match the expected sequence or a transition is not possible, the state machine returns to State 0.
